# :white_check_mark: To-Do List App
To Do List is a very simple yet useful application that allows users to add and delete in an intuitive way. It's easy to create a to-do list, then track progress and mark tasks as done. Thanks to this tool, you can manage your time and duties more effectively.


## :gear: Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Alternatively, you can use GitHub CLI, which allows you to clone, fork, and manage the repository directly from the command line. To clone the repository using GitHub CLI, type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gh repo clone klazyg/ToDo-List-App
```


## :point_right: First steps

To use the To-Do List App, input the necessary information into the form and click on the "Submit" button. Once this is done, the task will instantly appear in the table. 

Every task is assigned a unique ID which can be labeled as either completed or deleted. By carrying out these actions, the task will be automatically eliminated from both the database and the visible table.
