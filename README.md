# :white_check_mark: To-Do List App
To Do List is a very simple yet useful application that allows users to add and delete in an intuitive way. It's easy to create a to-do list, then track progress and mark tasks as done. Thanks to this tool, you can manage your time and duties more effectively.


## :gear: Running

After cloning the project repository, run the following command in the terminal to install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the development server, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, the project will be available at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You can also start editing the page by modifying the pages/index.tsx file. The page will automatically update as you edit the file.

Alternatively, you can use the GitHub CLI interface to clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
gh repo clone klazyg/ToDo-List-App
```


## :point_right: First steps

To use the To-Do List App, input the necessary information into the form and click on the "Submit" button. Once this is done, the task will instantly appear in the table. 

Every task is assigned a unique ID which can be labeled as either completed or deleted. By carrying out these actions, the task will be automatically eliminated from both the database and the visible table.
